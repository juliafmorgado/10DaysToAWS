This repository serves as a record of my progress in expanding my understanding of the AWS ecosystem as I prepare to take the certifications exams. I am allotting 10 days for preparation, study, and practice for each certification exam. Each day will be dedicated to specific topics and I will use various resources to cover those topics.

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.
