This repository serves as a record of my progress in expanding my understanding of the AWS ecosystem as I prepare to take the certifications exams. I am allotting 10 days for preparation, study, and practice for each certification exam. Each day will be dedicated to specific topics and I will use various resources to cover those topics.

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

This repo was inspired by [Michael Cade](https://twitter.com/MichaelCade1)'s [#90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) project. You should check it out!
